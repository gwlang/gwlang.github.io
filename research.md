### Metabolic Chemical Reporters
For my graduate studies, I am investigating the molecular consequences of the posttranslational modification called O-GlcNAc modification. This posttranslational modification is characterized by the addition of N-acetyl-glucosamine to serine and threonine side-chains. One of my projects aims to develop chemical tools, called metabolic chemical reporters, to identify and visualize proteins bearing O-GlcNAc modified residues. These compounds are structure analogs of naturally occurring metabolites with azides or alkynes at different positions. When added to living cells, they are incorporated onto O-GlcNAcylated residues and the azides/alkynes can undergo biorthogonal reactions, such as Cu(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC), for the installation of visualization, identification, and enrichment tags.

### Cystatin B
My other projects investigates how the O-GlcNAcylation of Cystatin B affects its regulation of a family of endogenous peptidases, called Cathepsins. Cathepsins are often upregulated in cancer, leading to chemoresistance, metastasis, and poor prognosis. O-GlcNAcylation is also upregulated in cancer. With the discovery of six O-GlcNAcylated residues in Cystatin B, my work will investigate how site-specific O-GlcNAcylation of Cystatin B affects its regulation of Cathepsins and its role in cancer development.
