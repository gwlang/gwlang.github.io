### Teaching Statement
I disliked my high school chemistry class, so when I walked into my first day of freshman general chemistry, I just wanted to pass and complete my GE requirement. After a mediocre score on my first exam, I asked my teaching assistants (TAs) after lab to help explain confusing topics from the lecture. They patiently worked with me until I finally got it. Their willingness to tutor me helped me become the chemist I am today. My goal as a TA and a tutor is help students learn chemistry so they may use this knowledge to further their ambitions.
